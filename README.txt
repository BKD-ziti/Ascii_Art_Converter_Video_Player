<---ベイクドジーティ--->

So over the past year ive been learning on my own and so far ive been focusing Python, Javascript, C++.
This was my first idea when i finally got the hang of it, in the future i might do some web based art project among many other things.

Hopefully i can get this to work in one way or another. 

Feel free to send me any info, advice, or tips to bkdziti@gmail.com.
